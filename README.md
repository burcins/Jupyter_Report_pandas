# Jupyter_Report_pandas

In this report, I used a dataset published at this link ;
https://www.transtats.bts.gov/Tables.asp?DB_ID=120&DB_Name=Airline%20On-Time%20Performance%20Data&DB_Short_Name=On-Time

I investigated 2017 dataset and this report based on an assignment, which is mostly based on Pandas functions, from my postgraduate as well..
